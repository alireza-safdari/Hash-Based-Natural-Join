# Hash-Based-Natural-Join-for-Database
This project is for CSCE-608 Texas A&amp;M. It is a hash based joined with simulation of RAM and secondary storage. (the access times are not modified, just different portion of memory are used)

The code was developed in Visual Studio 2019. I have tested the code on Windows, however I do not think it would face any issue on Linux since I did not use any Windows only library.

Please check the report.pdf for more information.
